ðŸ“– Project Description

This project focuses on building a Movie Rating Prediction model using the IMDb Movies India dataset. The goal is to predict the rating of a movie based on features such as its genre, director, and main actors. By combining data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling, the project provides insights into how different factors influence a movieâ€™s success and audience reception.

The workflow includes:

Data Loading & Cleaning â€“ Extracting data from compressed files, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset.

Feature Transformation â€“ Encoding categorical features like genre, director, and actors using one-hot encoding.

Model Training â€“ Implementing a regression pipeline with Linear Regression.

Evaluation â€“ Measuring performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score to assess accuracy.

This project not only demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in entertainment analytics, but also serves as a beginner-friendly template for tackling real-world regression problems with categorical data.
